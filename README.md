# DesertRatRunner: An Eldritch Horror Desert Rat Running Simulator

This is one of my term projects for CSC222 at NVCC. The idea was to implement a Desert object with a randomly generated grid of Cells and run Rats through
them until one finds the exit before dying.

The design document was given to my professor and wasn't written by him, and as a result it contains a lot of inconsistencies and contradictions. 
I tried to salvage what it was asking for and create something that conformed as closely to the specification as possible, but due to its chaotic 
nature, some of the methods were implemented but never used because they didn't make sense in the context of that program.

The Interface files and the ObjectGenerator class were given as templates, everything else was written by myself.
